# deadline-hide-and-seek

A Hide and Seek like game for Deadline on Roblox.

I made this in a day, so expect bugs.

## How to set up
You need to do this on your own __vip server__.

Open the console window and find the autoload tabs. Then copy the code below.
```lua
-- server autoload
require("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KrivanTomas/deadline-hide-and-seek/main/server.lua")
```

```lua
-- client autoload
-- I don't know of a way to load this file like on the server side, so just copy the whole
-- code from this link
-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KrivanTomas/deadline-hide-and-seek/main/client.lua
```
Restart the server after this (by having all the players leave)

## How to play and configure
In the same widget where you paste the mod code you should see a new tab called 'Hide and Seek'.
Here you can find the game settings and also force the game to start. (As of now this is the only way
to start the game because I'm lazy)

When configuring the game don't forget to press the 'Save' button on the botttom. Entering wrong types of values
in the fields may break the game.
